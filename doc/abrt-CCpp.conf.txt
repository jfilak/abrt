NAME

abrt-CCpp.conf - Configuration file for ABRT's core dump crash hook

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
Ithe following items are recognized:

MakeCompatCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   CCpp hook writes its template to the "/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" file
   and stores the original template in the "/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern"
   file. If you want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
   the original template as well, set 'MakeCompatCore' to 'yes'.
   If the original template string starts with "|", the string "core" is used
   instead of the template.
   For more information about naming core dump files see 'man 5 core'.

SaveBinaryImage = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
   Useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults.
   Default is 'no'.

CreateCoreBacktrace = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   When this option is set to 'yes', core backtrace is generated
   from the memory image of the crashing process. Only the crash
   thread is present in the backtrace. This feature requires
   kernel 3.18 or newer, otherwise the core backtrace is not
   created.
   Default is 'yes'.

SaveFullCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Save full coredump? If set to 'no', coredump won't be saved
   and you won't be able to report the crash to Bugzilla. Only
   useful with 'CreateCoreBacktrace' set to 'yes'. Please
   note that if this option is set to 'no' and MakeCompatCore
   is set to 'yes', the core is still written to the current
   directory.
   Default is 'yes'.

VerboseLog = NUM::
   Used to make the hook more verbose
