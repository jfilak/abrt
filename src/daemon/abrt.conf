# A name of event which is run automatically after problem's detection. The
# event should perform some fast analysis and exit with 70 if the

# Enables various features exploring process's root directories if they differ
# from the default root directory. The folowing list includes examples of
# enabled features:
#   * query the rpm database in the process's root directory
#   * save files like /etc/os-release from the process's root directory
#
# This feature is disabled by default because it might be used by a local user
# to steal your data.

# Caution:
#
# THIS FEATURE MIGHT BE USED BY A LOCAL USER TO STEEL YOUR DATA BY ARRANGING A
# SPECIAL ROOT DIRECTORY IN USER MOUNT NAMESAPCE

# Informs ABRT tools about the changed file system root path. This option is
# particularly useful when the system's root file system is not the same as the
# tool's file system. Exporting the ABRT_SYSROOT_PATH environment variable has
# the same effect on newly started programs with this environment.
# The environment variable takes precedence.
#
# For example, ABRT will instruct rpm to read rpm database from this path.
# Another example are ABRT log watchers (kernel oops, Xorg) which must read
# /etc/os-release from the system's root file system.

# SysRootPath = /

# Allows ABRT tools to detect problems in ABRT itself. By increasing the value
# you can force ABRT to detect, process and report problems in ABRT. You have
# to bare in mind that ABRT might fall into an infinite loop when handling
# problems caused by itself.
# The default is 0 (non debug mode).
